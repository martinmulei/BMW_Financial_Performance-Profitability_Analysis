## Data Source

- Publicly available **Kaggle dataset** containing BMW operational and financial data  
- ~50,000 rows × 16 columns, including:  
  - Model, Year, Engine Size, Fuel Type, Transmission, Region  
  - Mileage, Units Sold, Price, Revenue, Sales Classification  

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Excel** – Data cleaning, validation, and exploration  
- **Power Query** – Structured transformation and feature engineering  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard development and visualization  
- **DAX** – Custom measures for Revenue YoY %, Profit Margin, Variance %, and Unit Sales Performance  

---

## Data Preparation & Transformation

- Cleaned and validated the dataset in Excel  
- Transformed data in Power Query: promoted headers, corrected types, removed irrelevant columns, and fixed missing/erroneous values  
- Added calculated fields: Cost per Unit, Total Cost, Gross Profit, Revenue Share, Revenue Variance  

---

## Data Modeling

- **Date Table** – Enables time-based analysis (YoY growth, trends)  
- **Region Table** – Standardizes geographic segmentation for filters and comparisons  
- **Budgeted Revenue Table** – Supports variance analysis against targets  

### Key DAX Measures

- Total Revenue  
- Total Units Sold  
- Gross Profit  
- Profit Margin %  
- Revenue YoY %  
- Units YoY %  
- Revenue Variance %  
- Unit Sales Performance Index  

---

## Visualizations & Dashboard

1. **Executive KPIs** – Revenue vs Target, Units Sold, Profit Margin, YoY Growth  
2. **Revenue & Margin Trends** – Revenue and profit margin over time (2010–2030)  
3. **Regional Insights** – Interactive revenue contribution by region  
4. **Product & Engine Category Analysis** – Gross profit distribution by engine size, sales by pricing tier  

---

## Key Insights

- Unit sales growth (+233%) exceeded targets but revenue growth lagged, indicating pricing/mix challenges  
- Profit margin averaged ~25% with historical dips below 10%  
- Large-engine vehicles drive 41% of gross profit, highlighting premium segment reliance  
- Asia leads revenue ($3.3T), with opportunities for Africa and South America growth  
- Revenue volatility in 2021–2022 demonstrates sensitivity to macroeconomic and industry challenges  

---

## Recommendations

- Align pricing strategy with unit sales growth to protect margins  
- Expand profitability in medium and small engine segments  
- Introduce recurring revenue streams (after-sales, EV ecosystem, digital services)  
- Strengthen emerging markets for geographic diversification  
- Improve supply chain and cost efficiency to stabilize margins
